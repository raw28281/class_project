		<h1>History and Credits</h1>

			<p>SEE I Can Read™ children's books are designed to teach 3 to 6 year olds to read by themselves. The concept was conceived as Cris Lindsey, 
			President of Millennium 2000 Publishing Company, was working with his daughter Sarah. He wanted her to be able to read her own mail when he 
			wrote to her. He created the books to give his daughter as well as other children a sense of independence. The books were created using picture 
			illustrations to form the sentences, with the actual words written under the pictures so that the child can recognize the pictures and 
			associate it with the word beneath it.</p>

		<h1>Case Studies</h1>

			<p>This method has proven itself very effective with young children. Once they realize that they can read, by following the picture illustration, 
			they become so excited and their desire to read, becomes even greater. Now the child can read like big brother or big sister, like mommy and daddy, 
			which makes that little child feel important and not excluded. Now the child can pick up his or her book, and proceed to read to mommy, daddy, big 
			brother, or big sister. The child feels good about himself, and confident. This confidence generally carries on to other task they soon encounter 
			in their everyday adventures in life. It gives the children the desire to excel in all they attempt to do in their struggle to seek out their 
			independence.</p>
